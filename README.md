Hey Brad. I took some time today to get going on this first project of ours. I am by no means an expert at this so I do apologize for any weird problems I might have created in the layout of this page. I have included all the files and images I've been working with today. 

I figure we can clone the edits made from here, and then upload them to the CS Servers to work with the php files. After either of us makes an edit we can just push them back to this repository.

I put comments throughout the code if it's messy or confusing. Feel free to message me with any suggestions or questions. 

I've also uploaded an outline of the page layout.

Some things to look forward to adding:
 create pages for ingredients
 add pages as links to homepage in navbar, as well as to carousel
 user authentication
 make forms for users to submit comments

You can view the page off the CS Servers at www.cs.colostate.edu/~jurentie/Project01/project01.php
